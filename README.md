# coursera-data-structures-and-algorithms
Work related to Data Structures and Algorithms specialization study.

This repo contains anything related to my work on refreshing my
algoritmic knowledge by attending to [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms)
specialization on Coursera.

It consists mostly of programming assignments and some related scripts and experiments.

Main programming language for this repo currently is `Python 3`, but I would
definitely try to use something else (currently thinking about Haskell and 
Go maybe).
